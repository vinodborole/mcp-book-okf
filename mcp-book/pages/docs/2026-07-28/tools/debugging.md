## Debugging tools overview

MCP provides several tools for debugging at different levels:
1. **[MCP Inspector](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector)** : interactive, transport-agnostic
testing UI. Connect to stdio or Streamable HTTP servers, invoke[tools](/specification/latest/server/tools) ,[prompts](/specification/latest/server/prompts) , and[resources](/specification/latest/server/resources) , and watch the
notification stream. This should be your first stop.
2. **Server logging** : structured logs to stderr (stdio transport) or via[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (all transports).[Logging](/specification/2026-07-28/server/utilities/logging) over the protocol
(`notifications/message` ) is deprecated as of protocol version`2026-07-28` .
3. **Client developer tools** : most MCP clients expose logs and connection
state. See[Debugging in Claude Desktop](#debugging-in-claude-desktop) below for one example, or consult your client’s documentation.

## Implementing logging

### Server-side logging

When building a server that uses the local
[stdio transport](/specification/2026-07-28/basic/transports/stdio), all messages logged to stderr (standard error) will be captured by the host application automatically. For servers using the

[Streamable HTTP transport](/specification/2026-07-28/basic/transports/streamable-http), stderr is not captured by the client. Use your own server-side log aggregation or

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)for logs, and standard HTTP tooling (curl, browser DevTools Network panel) to inspect requests and SSE streams. For all

[transports](/specification/latest/basic/transports), record what the server is doing as it runs:

[RFC 5424 severity levels](/specification/latest/server/utilities/logging#log-levels)(

`debug` through `emergency`). Clients opt in to log messages per request by
setting the
[field in the request’s](/specification/2026-07-28/server/utilities/logging#per-request-log-level)

`io.modelcontextprotocol/logLevel``_meta`. Servers must not send `notifications/message`
for requests that omit this field.
Important events to log:
- Startup steps
- Resource access
- Tool execution
- Error conditions
- Performance metrics

## Common issues

The examples below use Claude Desktop’s
[; the same principles apply to any stdio-based MCP client.](/docs/2026-07-28/develop/connect-local-servers)

`claude_desktop_config.json`
### Working directory

When an MCP client launches a stdio server:
- The working directory for servers launched via the client’s config may be
undefined (like `/` on macOS) since the client could be started from
anywhere
- Always use absolute paths in your configuration and `.env` files to ensure
reliable operation
- For testing servers directly via command line, the working directory will be where you run the command

`claude_desktop_config.json`, use:
`./data`
### Environment variables

MCP servers launched over stdio inherit only a limited subset of environment variables automatically (the exact set is platform-dependent). To override the default variables or provide your own, you can specify an`env` key in `claude_desktop_config.json`:
### Server startup

Common startup problems:
1. 
**Path Issues**  - Incorrect server executable path
  - Missing required files
  - Permission problems
  - Try using an absolute path for `command`
2. 
**Configuration Errors**  - Invalid JSON syntax
  - Missing required fields
  - Type mismatches
3. 
**Environment Problems**  - Missing environment variables
  - Incorrect variable values
  - Permission restrictions

### Connection problems

When servers fail to connect:
1. Check client logs
2. Verify server process is running
3. Test standalone with [Inspector](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector)
4. Verify
[protocol compatibility](/docs/2026-07-28/learn/versioning#negotiation) : call[`server/discover`](/specification/2026-07-28/server/discover) to see which
protocol versions the server supports. An`UnsupportedProtocolVersionError` (`-32022` ) lists the server’s supported
versions in its`data` field
5. Check the
[per-request `_meta` fields](/specification/2026-07-28/basic/index#meta) :
every request must carry`io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion` and`io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities` , and clients should also
include`io.modelcontextprotocol/clientInfo` . A request missing either
required field is rejected with error`-32602` (Invalid params), the same
code returned for many other malformed inputs. If the server needs a
capability the request’s`clientCapabilities` did not declare, such as[elicitation](/specification/2026-07-28/client/elicitation) , it returns a`MissingRequiredClientCapabilityError` (`-32021` ) naming the missing
capabilities. Inspect the request’s`_meta` and the[`server/discover`](/specification/2026-07-28/server/discover) response to
verify both sides declared what you expect

## Debugging in Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop is one of many MCP clients. It is available on macOS and Windows.
### Checking server status

Click the “Add files, connectors, and more” plus icon in the chat input, then hover over the
**Connectors**menu to see connected servers and available tools.

### Viewing logs

Log files are written to:
- macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs`

- Server connection events
- Configuration issues
- Runtime errors
- Message exchanges

### Using Chrome DevTools

Access Chrome’s developer tools inside Claude Desktop to investigate client-side errors:
1. Create a `developer_settings.json` file with`allowDevTools` set to true:

1. Open DevTools: `Command-Option-I` (macOS) or`Ctrl+Alt+I` (Windows)

- Main content window
- App title bar window

- Message payloads
- Connection timing

## Debugging workflow

### Development cycle

1. 
Initial Development
  - Use [Inspector](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector) for basic testing
  - Implement core functionality
  - Add logging points
2. Use 
3. 
Integration Testing
  - Test in your target MCP client
  - Monitor logs
  - Check error handling

### Testing changes

To test changes efficiently:
- **Configuration changes** : Restart the MCP client
- **Server code changes** : Restart the client (for Claude Desktop, fully quit
and reopen; closing the window is not enough)
- **Quick iteration** : Use[Inspector](/docs/2026-07-28/tools/inspector) during
development

## Best practices

### Logging strategy

1. 
**Structured Logging**  - Use consistent formats
  - Include context
  - Add timestamps
  - Track request IDs
2. 
**Error Handling**  - Log stack traces
  - Include error context
  - Track error patterns
  - Monitor recovery
3. 
**Performance Tracking**  - Log operation timing
  - Monitor resource usage
  - Track message sizes
  - Measure latency

### Security considerations

When debugging:
1. 
**Sensitive Data**  - Sanitize logs
  - Protect credentials
  - Mask personal information
2. 
**Access Control**  - Verify permissions
  - Check authentication
  - Monitor access patterns

[Security Best Practices](/docs/2026-07-28/tutorials/security/security_best_practices).
