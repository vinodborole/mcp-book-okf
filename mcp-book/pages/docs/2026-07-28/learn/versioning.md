`YYYY-MM-DD`, to indicate the last date backwards incompatible changes were made.
The protocol version will 

*not*be incremented when the protocol is updated, as long as the changes maintain backwards compatibility. This allows for incremental improvements while preserving interoperability.
## Revisions

Revisions may be marked as:
- **Draft** : in-progress specifications, not yet ready for consumption.
- **Current** : the current protocol version, which is ready for use and may continue to
receive backwards compatible changes.
- **Final** : past, complete specifications that will not be changed.

**current**protocol version is

## Feature States

Individual features of the specification may additionally be marked as
**Deprecated**under the

[feature lifecycle and deprecation policy](/community/feature-lifecycle): the feature remains part of the specification, but is scheduled for removal. Deprecated features document a migration path (or state that none is required) and remain in the specification for at least twelve months, or at least ninety days under the policy’s

[expedited-removal exception](/community/feature-lifecycle#expedited-removal), before they become eligible for removal, after which they may be

**Removed**in a future revision. Features that are currently Deprecated are listed in the

[deprecated features registry](/specification/2026-07-28/deprecated).

## Negotiation

Every request declares the protocol version it is using via the`io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion` key in its
[field, and the server accepts or rejects each request independently. On Streamable HTTP, the same value is also carried in the](/specification/2026-07-28/basic/index#meta)

`_meta`
[. Clients and servers](/specification/2026-07-28/basic/transports/streamable-http#protocol-version-header)

`MCP-Protocol-Version` header
**MAY**support multiple protocol versions simultaneously. If the server does not support the requested version, it responds with an

[listing the versions it does support. The client can then retry the request with a mutually supported version, or surface an error to the user if none exists. Clients that want to select a version up front can call](/specification/2026-07-28/basic/versioning#protocol-version-negotiation)

`UnsupportedProtocolVersionError`
[, a mandatory RPC that returns the server’s supported protocol versions, capabilities, and identity in a single request. Calling it is optional: a client is free to send any request directly and handle a version error if one comes back. For interoperability with servers and clients that implement the handshake-based protocol revisions (](/specification/2026-07-28/server/discover)

`server/discover``2025-11-25` and earlier), see
